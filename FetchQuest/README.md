Modification log: Created game folders and files.
Added necessary code to the files by following along with the coding steps from Roguelike Development with JavaScript: Build and Publish Roguelike Genre Games with JavaScript and Phaser by Andre Alves Garzia.
Finished adding code and began testing in Chrome; everything seems to be working.
Began customizing the game (all changes will be documented as comments in the game files). 
Added files to my CodeSandbox(link = https://hml8h.csb.app/); intro screen works in a browser window, but after the game initializes and the player moves their character two or three times the screen freezes and then an error screen appears. I added a sandbox.config.json file and it fixed one issue. But the remaining issue appears to be a dependency issue; I tried adding pathfinding.js to my dependency list but it didn't fix the issue.
